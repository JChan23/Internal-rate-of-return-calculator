# Internal-rate-of-return-calculator
Part of an internship program I'm doing.
Currently attemping to develop a calculator that can calculate the internal rate if return (IRR) of a portfolio

V1: Allows user to import data from an excel sheet. Calculations are done using fixed point iteration - very limited, as strict conditions must be met to perform these calculations
